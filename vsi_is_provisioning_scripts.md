# User data
{: #user-data}

When you launch an instance, you can add user data that automatically performs common configuration tasks or runs scripts. In the **User Data** field on the order form, you can enter optional cloud-init user data for the server.

## User data examples for Linux 
The following example shows how a Linux user can add a new user and provide the user with an authorized SSH key. The **Name** field will have the public key added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. 

```
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: demouser
    gecos: Demo User
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    groups: users, admin
    ssh_import_id: None
    lock_passwd: true
    ssh_authorized_keys:
        - <ssh public key>
```
{:codeblock}

Here's another example of shell script that shows how a Linux user can add an SSH key for the current user.

```
#!/bin/bash
echo <sshKey> > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
{:codeblock}

You can paste one of these examples directly into the **User Data** field. The user data is then available to the virtual server instance during provisioning.

## User data example for Windows
The following example shows how user data can be passed to a Windows instance. You can copy and paste this example directly into the **User Data** field.

```
#ps1_sysnative
Set-Content -Path "C:\\test.txt" -Value "Hello IBM Cloud Instance"
```
