# SSH keys
{: #ssh-keys}

SSH keys are used by SSH servers to identify a user or device through public-key cryptography. SSH keys are made up of an alpha-numeric combination and are unique to the device to which they are assigned. You can add, edit, or delete SSH keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console.
{:shortdesc}

SSH keys allow access to a device without using a password from corresponding clients for each public key that is implemented on the device. By adding an SSH key to a device, which can be done during provisioning, the device that was provided with the SSH key accesses the device for the corresponding key without the use of a password.

For more information about creating, editing, or deleting SSH keys, see [Managing SSH keys](vsi_is_ssh_keys.html).
